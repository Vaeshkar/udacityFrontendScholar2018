## Project 02 Build a Portfolio Site @ Added 2018.04.01
___
#### Description
Create a porfolio site from scartch using all that has been learned in the first part of the Udacity Frontend Develement Nanodegree course. Using only HTML + CSS knowledge. 

#### Concept and thoughts
On paper I designed 3 different viewports. Given the _project_ mockup was designed in desktop (960px) I started with a desktop-boxmodel. After that was done I jumped down one viewport towards the tablet-boxmodel (768px) and changed some design isues I saw on paper. After the tablet model was set I continued towards the mobile-boxmodel (400px) and worked to set all elements in a single column.

Using the Flexbox model and design pattern: layout shifter. Hint: Lesson 14.
Images used on the site should be using the <picture> tag so the browsers chooses the correctly generated images for each viewport. Hint: Free Course: Responsive Images, srcset.
